# Double Diamond — Deep Reference

The Double Diamond was created by the British Design Council in 2005, adapted from Bela H. Banathy's divergence-convergence model (1996).

## The Model

```
    PROBLEM SPACE                    SOLUTION SPACE
    Diamond 1                        Diamond 2

   /  Discover  \                  /  Develop   \
  /   (go wide)  \               /  (go wide)   \
 /    research    \             /   explore       \
/     explore      \           /    ideate         \
\     empathize    /           \    prototype      /
 \    listen      /             \   test          /
  \  Define      /               \  Deliver      /
   \ (focus)    /                 \ (focus)      /
    \__________/                   \____________/

     "The right              "The right
      problem"                solution"
```

## Four Phases

### 1. Discover (Diverge)
Understand the problem space. Research users, context, competitors, constraints. Go wide. Don't assume you know the problem.

**Activities:** User interviews, field studies, competitive analysis, analytics review, stakeholder conversations, desk research.

**Output:** Raw insights, observations, user needs, pain points.

### 2. Define (Converge)
Synthesize discoveries into a clear problem statement. What's the actual challenge? For whom? What does success look like?

**Activities:** Affinity mapping, persona creation, journey mapping, problem framing, design brief creation.

**Output:** Clear problem definition, design brief, success criteria.

### 3. Develop (Diverge)
Generate multiple possible solutions. Sketch, wireframe, prototype, explore. Don't commit to the first idea.

**Activities:** Brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, low-fi prototyping, cross-functional collaboration, user testing of concepts.

**Output:** Multiple solution directions, tested prototypes, validated concepts.

### 4. Deliver (Converge)
Test, refine, and ship the best solution. Iterate until it works, then release.

**Activities:** High-fi prototyping, usability testing, development, design QA, heuristic evaluation, launch.

**Output:** Shipped product, post-launch metrics, iteration backlog.

## Framework Mapping

| Double Diamond | Framework Phase | What you're doing |
|---|---|---|
| Discover | Phase 0 (Audit) | Understanding the project state, users, constraints |
| Define | Phase 0 (Audit) + Phase 1 (Tokens) | Defining the problem, establishing design foundations |
| Develop | Phase 2 (Assets) + Phase 3 (Design) | Exploring solutions, creating options, designing key screens |
| Deliver | Phase 4 (Build) + Phase 5 (Consistency) | Building, testing, polishing, shipping |

## Design Engineer Nuances

**Not all projects start at Discover.** The audit (Phase 0) tells you where you are:
- Greenfield -> Full double diamond
- Build What's Designed -> Diamond 1 done, enter at Diamond 2
- Rescue/Takeover -> Re-enter Diamond 1 to understand the real problem
- Polish & Ship -> Deep into Diamond 2's Deliver phase

**The most common mistake:** Jumping to Diamond 2 (building) before Diamond 1 (understanding) is done. Even when you're the designer AND the builder, sit in the problem space before opening your editor.

## Design Council's Four Principles

1. **Put people first** — Start with understanding of the people using the service
2. **Communicate visually and inclusively** — Help people gain shared understanding
3. **Collaborate and co-create** — Work together, get inspired by others
4. **Iterate, iterate, iterate** — Spot errors early, avoid risk, build confidence
