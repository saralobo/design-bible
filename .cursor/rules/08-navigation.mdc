# Navigation — Patterns and Rules for User Flow

> Bad navigation = confusing app. The user must ALWAYS know where they are,
> how they got there, and how to go back. No exceptions.

---

## MOBILE NAVIGATION TYPES

### 1. Bottom Navigation (Tab Bar)

**When to use**: App with 3-5 main sections at the same hierarchical level.

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Number of items | 3 to 5 (NEVER more than 5) |
| Height | 56-83px (including safe area) |
| Icon | 24px, centered |
| Label | 10-12px, below the icon |
| Active item | Filled icon + accent label + indicator (pill/dot) |
| Inactive item | Outline icon + neutral-600 label |
| Touch target | 48×48px minimum per item |

**Familiar patterns (Jakob's Law)**:
| Position | Typical Item |
|---|---|
| 1 (left) | Home |
| 2 | Search / Explore |
| 3 (center) | Main action (or FAB overlay) |
| 4 | Activity / Notifications |
| 5 (right) | Profile / Settings |

**ANTI-PATTERNS**:
- ❌ 6+ items in bottom nav (use drawer or internal tabs)
- ❌ Generic labels ("More", "Other")
- ❌ Icons without labels (zero accessibility)
- ❌ Bottom nav on modal or sub-flow screens

---

### 2. Top Navigation (Header/App Bar)

**When to use**: Every screen that isn't root (has a parent).

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Back    Screen Title    [⚙️]  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| Height | 44-56px |
| Back button | ← arrow on the left, 44×44px touch target |
| Title | Centered or left-aligned (choose ONE pattern) |
| Actions | Maximum 2 icons on the right |
| Title font | 18-20px SemiBold |

**RULES**:
- Root screen (Home, tabs): Large title on the left (Large Title style)
- Sub-screen: ← Back + centered title
- Modal: X (close) on left or right + centered title
- NEVER: Back button + Close button on the same screen (confusing)

---

### 3. Tabs (Segmented Navigation)

**When to use**: Same-level content within a section.

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Position | Below the header, sticky |
| Number of tabs | 2 to 5 |
| Active indicator | 2-3px accent line below the tab |
| Active font | SemiBold, accent or neutral-900 |
| Inactive font | Regular, neutral-600 |
| Swipe | Tab content can have horizontal swipe |
| Scroll | If >4 tabs, horizontal scroll |

---

### 4. Drawer / Side Menu

**When to use**: App with many sections (>5) or complex settings.

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Width | 80% of the screen (max 320px) |
| Overlay | 50-60% opacity background |
| Open | Swipe from left edge or hamburger icon ☰ |
| Close | Swipe left, tap on overlay, or X |
| Items | 24px icon + 16px label, 48px height per item |
| Separators | Dividers between item groups |

---

## NAVIGATION PATTERNS

### Stack Navigation (Push/Pop):
```
Home → List → Detail → Edit
 ←      ←       ←        ←
```
- Each screen is "stacked" on top of the previous one
- Back returns to the previous screen
- Transition: Slide in from right (push), slide out to right (pop)

### Modal Navigation:
```
Screen A → [Modal B] → Screen A (returned)
```
- Modal "floats" above the current screen
- Close (X) or swipe down to dismiss
- Transition: Slide up (open), slide down (close)
- Background gets a dark overlay

### Tab Navigation:
```
Tab 1 ↔ Tab 2 ↔ Tab 3
```
- Tabs are parallel, same level
- Each tab can have its own navigation stack
- Transition: Cross-fade or horizontal swipe

---

## BREADCRUMBS

**When to use**: Deep hierarchies (>3 levels), mainly web/tablet.

```
Home > Category > Subcategory > Product
```

### Rules:
- Separator: ">" or "/" (12px, neutral-400)
- Clickable items: accent, underline on hover
- Current item: neutral-900, not clickable
- Mobile: Show only the previous level (← Subcategory)

---

## NAVIGATION GESTURES

| Gesture | Action | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Swipe right from edge | Back (return) | iOS, stack screens |
| Swipe down | Close modal/bottom sheet | Modals, sheets |
| Horizontal swipe | Switch tab, next item | Tabs, carousels |
| Swipe left on item | Reveal actions (delete, archive) | Lists |
| Long press | Context menu | List items, images |
| Pull down | Refresh | Lists, feeds |
| Pinch | Zoom | Images, maps |

### RULE:
> Gestures are SHORTCUTS, not the only way to interact.
> Every gesture-accessible action MUST have a button alternative.

---

## DEEP LINKING AND WAYFINDING

### The user must ALWAYS know:
1. **Where they are**: Screen title, active tab, breadcrumbs
2. **Where they came from**: Functional back button
3. **Where they can go**: Clear CTAs, visible nav items
4. **How to get back to the start**: Home in bottom nav, clickable logo

### State Indicators:
- Badge with number: Pending notifications
- Red dot: New content
- Highlight/Bold: Unread item
- Checkmark: Completed item

---

## NAVIGATION TRANSITIONS

| Type | Duration | Easing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Push (→) | 300-350ms | ease-in-out / gentle | Stack forward |
| Pop (←) | 300-350ms | ease-in-out / gentle | Stack back |
| Modal up (↑) | 300-400ms | ease-out | Open modal |
| Modal down (↓) | 250-300ms | ease-in | Close modal |
| Fade | 200-250ms | ease-in-out | Tab switch |
| None | 0ms | — | Tabs (if no animation) |

### IN FIGMA (Prototyping):
```javascript
// Stack navigation
transition: 'SLIDE_IN'    // or SLIDE_OUT for back
direction: 'LEFT'         // push forward = slide in from right (LEFT direction)
duration: 0.35            // 350ms
easing: { type: 'GENTLE' }

// Modal
transition: 'SLIDE_IN'
direction: 'BOTTOM'       // slide up
duration: 0.35
easing: { type: 'EASE_IN_AND_OUT' }
```

## NAVIGATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Does the user know where they are on every screen?
- [ ] Do all screens (except root) have a back button?
- [ ] Does bottom nav have 3-5 items with icons + labels?
- [ ] Do gestures have a button alternative?
- [ ] Are transitions consistent (same type and duration)?
- [ ] Do modals close with X AND with gesture?
- [ ] Do sub-flows hide the main bottom nav?
- [ ] Do tabs clearly indicate which one is active?
