# Motion & Transitions — Animation with Purpose

> Animation without purpose is decoration. Animation with purpose is communication.
> Every millisecond must have a reason.

---

## FUNDAMENTAL MOTION PRINCIPLES

### 1. Functional, Not Decorative
- Animation must COMMUNICATE something: relationship, hierarchy, state, or direction
- If you remove the animation and nothing changes in comprehension → the animation is unnecessary

### 2. Fast and Smooth
- Perception of speed > actual speed
- Animations should START fast and decelerate (ease-out)
- The user should not WAIT for the animation

### 3. Natural and Physical
- Objects don't teleport — they MOVE
- Objects don't stop abruptly — they DECELERATE
- Heavy objects move slower than light objects

### 4. Consistent
- Same type of transition for the same type of action
- Same duration for the same category of animation
- Consistent easing curves throughout the app

## STANDARD DURATIONS

| Category | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Micro** | 100-150ms | Hover, press, toggle, ripple |
| **Small** | 150-250ms | Fade in/out, color change, tooltip |
| **Medium** | 250-400ms | Slide in/out, scale, modal open |
| **Large** | 400-700ms | Page transition, complex animation |
| **Emphasis** | 500-1000ms | Success animation, celebration |

### GOLDEN RULE:
> If > 400ms for a screen transition, the user feels SLOWNESS.
> If < 150ms for a screen transition, the user doesn't PERCEIVE the animation.
> Sweet spot: **300-350ms** for most transitions.

## EASING CURVES (Acceleration Curves)

### Easing Types:

| Curve | CSS | Use | Feel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ease-out** | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1) | Elements ENTERING | Fast start, smooth end |
| **ease-in** | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1) | Elements EXITING | Smooth start, fast end |
| **ease-in-out** | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) | Elements CHANGING state | Smooth-fast-smooth |
| **gentle** | Figma built-in | Elegant transitions | Very smooth, premium feel |
| **linear** | linear | Progress bars, spinners | Constant speed (robotic) |
| **spring** | Custom | Bouncy, playful UI | Overshoot and settling |

### IN FIGMA:
```javascript
// For prototyping:
easing: { type: 'EASE_IN_AND_OUT' }     // Universal default
easing: { type: 'GENTLE' }               // Premium, elegant
easing: { type: 'EASE_OUT' }             // Elements entering
easing: { type: 'EASE_IN' }              // Elements exiting
easing: { type: 'LINEAR' }               // Progress, spinners
easing: { type: 'CUSTOM_SPRING', stiffness: 300, damping: 25 }  // Spring
```

### WHEN TO USE EACH CURVE:
| Action | Curve |
|---|---|
| Screen appearing | ease-out (arrives fast, settles smooth) |
| Screen exiting | ease-in (accelerates out) |
| Modal opening | ease-out or gentle |
| Modal closing | ease-in |
| Toggle/Switch | ease-in-out |
| Fade in | ease-out |
| Fade out | ease-in |
| Value transition (counter) | ease-in-out |
| Spinner rotation | linear |

## SCREEN TRANSITIONS

### Stack Navigation (Forward / Push):
```
Screen A → Screen B
[Screen A slides out left] + [Screen B slides in from right]
```
- Type: SLIDE_IN, direction: LEFT
- Duration: 300-350ms
- Easing: gentle or ease-in-out

### Stack Navigation (Back / Pop):
```
Screen B → Screen A
[Screen B slides out right] + [Screen A slides in from left]
```
- Type: SLIDE_OUT, direction: RIGHT
- Duration: 300-350ms
- Easing: gentle or ease-in-out

### Modal (Open):
```
[Overlay fades in] + [Sheet slides up from bottom]
```
- Type: SLIDE_IN, direction: BOTTOM
- Duration: 350-400ms
- Easing: ease-out or gentle

### Modal (Close):
```
[Sheet slides down] + [Overlay fades out]
```
- Type: SLIDE_OUT, direction: BOTTOM
- Duration: 250-300ms
- Easing: ease-in

### Tab Switch:
```
[Tab A fades out] + [Tab B fades in]
```
- Type: DISSOLVE or SMART_ANIMATE
- Duration: 200-250ms
- Easing: ease-in-out

## SMART ANIMATE IN FIGMA

### When to use:
- Elements that change size, position, color, or opacity between frames
- Micro-interactions within the same screen (expand card, move item)
- Complex transitions with multiple changing elements

### Requirements:
- **Same names**: Layers with the SAME name in both frames are animated
- **Properties that animate**: x, y, width, height, rotation, opacity, fills
- **Properties that DON'T animate**: text content, effects (needs workaround)

### TIP:
> To create a micro-interaction with SMART_ANIMATE:
> 1. Duplicate the frame (state A)
> 2. Modify the desired elements in the duplicate (state B)
> 3. Connect A → B with SMART_ANIMATE + ON_CLICK or ON_HOVER

## MOTION VALUES (Material Design 3 Reference)

### Duration Tokens:
| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| duration-short1 | 50ms | Micro-ripple |
| duration-short2 | 100ms | Press feedback |
| duration-short3 | 150ms | Tooltip, hover |
| duration-short4 | 200ms | Selection, toggle |
| duration-medium1 | 250ms | Fade, small slide |
| duration-medium2 | 300ms | Standard transition |
| duration-medium3 | 350ms | Page transition |
| duration-medium4 | 400ms | Complex transition |
| duration-long1 | 450ms | Large element |
| duration-long2 | 500ms | Full page |
| duration-long3 | 550ms | Route change |
| duration-long4 | 600ms | Celebration |
| duration-extra-long1 | 700ms | Success animation |
| duration-extra-long2 | 800ms | Complex entrance |

## MOTION HIERARCHY

### Elements enter in sequence (stagger):
```
Header:     [====]           ← 0ms delay
Title:       [====]          ← 50ms delay
Subtitle:     [====]         ← 100ms delay
Content:       [====]        ← 150ms delay
CTA:            [====]       ← 200ms delay
```

- Stagger delay: 30-60ms between elements
- Each element: 200-300ms fade + slide up
- Easing: ease-out for each element

### RULE:
> Stagger is SUBTLE. If total delay > 400ms, the user feels slowness.
> Maximum 4-5 elements in stagger. More than that → all together.

## MOTION ANTI-PATTERNS

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|---|---|
| Animation > 700ms for transition | 300-350ms for most |
| Bounce/overshoot in serious app | Gentle/ease-in-out for professional apps |
| Elements entering from all directions | Consistent direction (left→right for forward) |
| Linear easing for everything | Appropriate easing curves by type |
| Loading animation blocking interaction | Non-blocking loading (skeleton) |
| Animation everywhere without purpose | Animation only where it communicates something |
| Delay before starting to animate | Immediate start (0ms delay) |

## MOTION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Does each animation have a CLEAR purpose?
- [ ] Screen transition duration: 300-350ms?
- [ ] Easing curve is gentle or ease-in-out (not linear)?
- [ ] Entering elements use ease-out?
- [ ] Exiting elements use ease-in?
- [ ] Smart Animate has layers with matching names?
- [ ] Total stagger doesn't exceed 400ms?
- [ ] Loading animations are non-blocking?
- [ ] Screen transitions are consistent across the entire app?
- [ ] Celebrations (success) are longer and more elaborate?
