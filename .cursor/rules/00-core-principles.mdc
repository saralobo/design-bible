# RULE ZERO — Fundamental Design Principles

> This document is the foundation of EVERYTHING. Before creating any visual element, these rules are inviolable.

## BEFORE CREATING ANY SCREEN

1. **Define the visual hierarchy** — What should the user see FIRST? SECOND? THIRD?
2. **One primary action per screen** — Never compete with 2 CTAs of equal visual weight
3. **Breathe** — White space is not waste, it's clarity
4. **Consistency over creativity** — If the design system defines a pattern, follow it. Always.
5. **Mobile-first** — Start from the smallest viewport and expand

## THE 4 PILLARS OF VISUAL DESIGN

### 1. Hierarchy
- **Size** — The most important element is the largest
- **Weight** — Bold for headings, regular for body
- **Color** — Vibrant colors for actions, neutrals for support
- **Position** — The eye reads in an F-pattern (web) or centered (mobile)
- **Spacing** — More space around = more importance

### 2. Contrast
- Don't use similar colors side by side
- Text over background needs a minimum ratio of 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Large text (>18px bold or >24px regular): minimum ratio 3:1
- NEVER light gray on white — it's invisible
- Dark mode: Don't use pure white (#FFFFFF) on pure black (#000000) — causes visual vibration. Use #E0E0E0 on #121212

### 3. Alignment
- **Everything aligns to something** — If an element isn't aligned to any other, it's wrong
- Use an 8px grid for EVERYTHING (spacing, padding, margin, sizes)
- Left-align by default (LTR languages)
- Center only for screen titles, modals, and empty states
- NEVER mix different alignments in the same section

### 4. Proximity
- Related elements stay TOGETHER (8-12px)
- Unrelated elements stay APART (24-32px+)
- Space between groups must be AT LEAST 2x the space between items within the same group
- Label + Input = 4-8px gap
- Different sections = 32-48px gap

## GOLDEN RULES FOR MOBILE

### Touch Targets
- **Absolute minimum**: 44×44px (Apple HIG) / 48×48dp (Material Design)
- **Recommended**: 48×48px
- **Spacing between targets**: minimum 8px
- **Circular button MUST be circular**: width === height, cornerRadius = width/2
- NEVER create an oval button when the intent is circular

### Safe Areas
- **Top**: Respect the status bar (44px iOS, 24dp Android)
- **Bottom**: Respect the home indicator (34px iOS) and navigation bar
- **Thumb zone**: Primary actions in the bottom half of the screen (thumb reach)
- **Danger zone**: Top-left corner = hardest to reach

### Minimum Text Sizes
- **Body**: 16px minimum (NEVER smaller)
- **Caption/Helper**: 12px minimum (NEVER smaller)
- **Input label**: 14-16px
- **Screen title**: 20-28px
- **Display/Hero**: 32-48px

## PREDICTABILITY PRINCIPLE

The user must ALWAYS know:
1. **Where they are** — Screen title, breadcrumbs, active tab
2. **What they can do** — Visible buttons, clear affordances
3. **What will happen** — Descriptive labels ("Send Payment" not "Confirm")
4. **How to go back** — Back button, gesture, X to close

## PRE-CREATION CHECKLIST

Before creating any screen in Figma, answer:

- [ ] What is the SINGLE primary action of this screen?
- [ ] What is the visual hierarchy? (1st, 2nd, 3rd element)
- [ ] Does the spacing follow the 8px grid?
- [ ] Do touch targets have at least 44×44px?
- [ ] Is text contrast sufficient (4.5:1)?
- [ ] Does the user know how to go back?
- [ ] Is there enough breathing room between sections?
- [ ] Are all circular buttons ACTUALLY circular (width = height)?
