# UX Laws — Scientific Foundation for Design Decisions

> Based on lawsofux.com (Jon Yablonski), cognitive psychology, and usability research.
> Each law includes: definition, explanation, and PRACTICAL RULE for Figma application.

---

## 1. FITTS'S LAW

**Definition**: The time to reach a target is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target.

**Formula**: T = a + b × log₂(2D/W)
- T = movement time
- D = distance to target
- W = width/size of target

**Explanation**: The larger and closer the button, the faster the user clicks it. The smaller and farther, the more time and errors.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Primary CTA**: ALWAYS the largest button on screen. Minimum 48px height, preferably full-width on mobile
- **Destructive actions**: Smaller and farther from the main CTA (prevent accidental clicks)
- **FAB (Floating Action Button)**: 56×56px, positioned in the thumb zone (bottom-right corner)
- **Header buttons**: Minimum 44×44px touch target, even if the visual icon is 24px
- **Frequent actions**: Near the center or bottom of the screen (thumb zone)
- **NEVER**: Place primary action in the top-left corner on mobile (hardest to reach)

---

## 2. HICK'S LAW

**Definition**: The time to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

**Formula**: T = b × log₂(n + 1)
- T = decision time
- n = number of options

**Explanation**: Many options = paralysis. Few options = quick action.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Main navigation**: Maximum 5 items (bottom nav: 3-5 items)
- **Options menu**: If more than 7 items, group into categories
- **Form**: Maximum 5-7 visible fields at a time. Use progressive disclosure for more
- **Onboarding**: One choice per screen. NEVER overload the first experience
- **Dropdown/Select**: If more than 10 options, use search/filter
- **Actions per screen**: 1 primary + maximum 2 secondary
- **NEVER**: Show 10+ action buttons on the same screen

---

## 3. JAKOB'S LAW

**Definition**: Users spend most of their time on OTHER sites/apps. They prefer your product to work the same way as the ones they already know.

**Explanation**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Familiar patterns reduce cognitive load.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Bottom navigation**: Tab bar at the bottom (don't invent custom nav)
- **Back button**: Top-left corner with ← arrow (don't use X for back navigation)
- **Pull to refresh**: Standard gesture, don't change it
- **Swipe to delete**: Swipe left reveals destructive action (red)
- **Search**: Magnifying glass icon 🔍, search field at the top
- **Settings**: Gear icon ⚙️, accessible from profile or menu
- **NEVER**: Create custom gestures without onboarding. The user won't guess

---

## 4. MILLER'S LAW

**Definition**: The average person can hold 7 (±2) items in working memory.

**Explanation**: Group information into chunks of no more than 4-5 items for easier processing.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Phone number**: Group into chunks: (11) 9 8765-4321, not 11987654321
- **Card number**: 4 groups of 4 digits: 1234 5678 9012 3456
- **PIN/OTP code**: Separate fields per digit (4-6 individual fields)
- **Item list**: If exceeding 5-7 items, group with headers/sections
- **Stepper/Wizard**: Maximum 5-7 visible steps in the progress indicator
- **Price/Value**: Use thousand separators: $1,234.56 (not $1234.56)
- **NEVER**: Show more than 7 items without visual categorization

---

## 5. VON RESTORFF EFFECT (Isolation Effect)

**Definition**: When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs most from the others is most remembered.

**Explanation**: The item that "stands out" is what the user memorizes and acts upon.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Primary CTA**: Solid accent color (the ONLY element with that color on screen). Other buttons = outlined or ghost
- **Notification badge**: Red with white number — contrasts against any background
- **Promotional price**: Different color + larger size than the original price
- **Active state**: Selected tab/item must be VISIBLY different from the rest
- **Error**: Red + icon. Never rely only on color (color blindness)
- **NEVER**: Use the same color/weight/size for the main CTA and secondary actions

---

## 6. SERIAL POSITION EFFECT

**Definition**: People tend to remember the first (primacy effect) and last (recency effect) items in a series.

**Explanation**: Place the most important at the beginning OR at the end. The middle is forgotten.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Bottom navigation**: Main action in the 1st or last item (Home on the left, Profile on the right)
- **Feature list**: Most important first, second most important last
- **Onboarding**: First and last screens are the most memorable
- **Menu**: Most-used items at the top, least-used in the middle
- **Form fields**: Most critical field at the top (e.g., email before preferences)
- **NEVER**: Place the most important action in the middle of a 5+ item list

---

## 7. DOHERTY THRESHOLD

**Definition**: Productivity soars when human-computer interactions occur in less than 400 milliseconds.

**Explanation**: If the system takes more than 400ms to respond, the user loses their mental flow.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Touch feedback**: Visual response in < 100ms (ripple, highlight, scale)
- **Screen transition**: 200-500ms (300ms is the sweet spot)
- **Loading state**: If > 1 second, show skeleton/shimmer
- **Progress indicator**: If > 3 seconds, show progress bar with percentage
- **Micro-interaction animation**: 150-300ms
- **NEVER**: Leave the user without feedback for more than 400ms after an action

---

## 8. AESTHETIC-USABILITY EFFECT

**Definition**: Aesthetically pleasing designs are perceived as easier to use.

**Explanation**: Beauty builds trust. Beautiful interfaces make users tolerate more small issues.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Generous spacing**: 16-24px padding inside cards/containers
- **Clean typography**: Maximum 2 weights per screen (regular + semibold/bold)
- **Consistent colors**: Maximum 3 main colors + neutrals
- **Consistent border radius**: Choose 1 value (8px, 12px, or 16px) and use it for EVERYTHING
- **Subtle shadows**: One light shadow (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)) for elevation
- **NEVER**: Mix different border-radius values (8px on one card, 16px on another, 4px on a third)

---

## 9. PEAK-END RULE

**Definition**: People judge an experience based on the most intense moment (peak) and the ending, not the total sum.

**Explanation**: The WOW moment and the conclusion define how the user REMEMBERS the experience.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Success screen**: Invest design here! Animation, vibrant color, animated check
- **Onboarding**: Last screen should be memorable (not generic)
- **Checkout**: Purchase confirmation = visual celebration
- **Error recovery**: After an error, the resolution should be smooth and satisfying
- **Loading → Result**: The content reveal after loading should feel rewarding
- **NEVER**: End a flow with a generic screen without emotion ("Done.")

---

## 10. ZEIGARNIK EFFECT

**Definition**: People remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones.

**Explanation**: A progress bar at 80% creates urgency to complete.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Profile progress**: "Your profile is 70% complete" motivates completion
- **Stepper/Wizard**: Clearly show "Step 2 of 4" with a progress bar
- **Onboarding**: Visible progress indicator (dots or bar)
- **Gamification**: Partially earned badges/medals motivate action
- **Long forms**: Auto-save drafts, show progress
- **NEVER**: Hide progress in multi-step flows

---

## 11. TESLER'S LAW (Conservation of Complexity)

**Definition**: Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed. The question is: who deals with it — the system or the user?

**Explanation**: Absorb complexity into the design. The user should not solve system problems.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Autocomplete**: Fill in as much as possible automatically (ZIP → address)
- **Smart defaults**: Pre-select the most common option
- **Auto-formatting**: Phone, SSN, ZIP should format while typing
- **Inline validation**: Validate field by field, not everything on submit
- **NEVER**: Make the user type information the system can infer

---

## 12. POSTEL'S LAW (Robustness Principle)

**Definition**: Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept.

**Explanation**: Accept various input formats, but always display in the correct format.

### PRACTICAL RULES:
- **Phone**: Accept with or without parentheses, dashes, country codes
- **Email**: Case-insensitive, trim whitespace
- **Search**: Tolerate typos, suggest corrections
- **Date**: Accept various formats (01/01/2025, 1/1/25, 01-01-2025, Jan 1 2025)
- **Currency**: Accept with or without symbols and separators
- **NEVER**: Reject a valid input because of formatting
