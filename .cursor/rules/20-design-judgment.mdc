# Rule 20 — Design Judgment: Spirit Over Letter

> **This is the most important rule in the entire Design Bible.**
>
> Following rules mechanically without design taste makes screens WORSE,
> not better. Rules are guidelines — JUDGMENT is what makes design good.
> This document captures hard-won lessons from real failures.

---

## THE CARDINAL RULE

```
Rules exist to GUIDE judgment, not REPLACE it.

If following a rule makes the screen uglier, the rule is being
applied wrong — not the screen.
```

---

## LESSON 1: COLOR RESTRAINT MEANS RESTRAINT

### ❌ What went wrong:
Added red (#E50914) for Netflix merchant icon and green (#34C759) for
"Available $2,152.50" text because the color rules say "use semantic colors."

### ✅ The correct interpretation:
Semantic colors (red = error, green = success) are for **system states**
(validation errors, success messages), NOT for content decoration.

```
WRONG: Netflix icon in red because "Netflix brand is red"
RIGHT: All merchant icons in the same neutral surface color

WRONG: "Available $2,152.50" in green because "available = positive"
RIGHT: All financial metadata in neutral gray — the NUMBER speaks for itself

WRONG: Multiple accent colors on one screen
RIGHT: ONE accent color, used in LESS than 5% of the screen (CTA + 1 detail)
```

### The Rule:
**On any given screen, count the distinct non-neutral colors. If you have more
than 2 (the accent + one status indicator), you have too many.** The premium
apps (Nubank, Cash App, Linear) use essentially 1 color + grays.

---

## LESSON 2: DON'T FIX WHAT ISN'T BROKEN

### ❌ What went wrong:
The original screen (v1) used text characters ($, ⊘, ≡, ⊙) as icons inside
circle containers. They looked clean and polished. Rule 17 says "don't use
raw text as icons." So v2 replaced them with crude hand-drawn vector paths
that looked terrible.

### ✅ The correct interpretation:
Rule 17's INTENT is "icons should be visually consistent." A clean text
character inside a proper FIXED container achieves this perfectly. A crude
hand-drawn vector path VIOLATES the intent while following the letter.

```
WRONG: "Rule 17 says no text, so I'll draw crude SVG paths"
RIGHT: "Rule 17 says be consistent, so I'll use clean chars in FIXED containers"

The hierarchy of icon quality:
1. BEST:  Proper icon library (Phosphor, Lucide, SF Symbols) — if available
2. GOOD:  Clean text characters inside FIXED containers — proven, consistent
3. BAD:   Hand-drawn vector paths — crude, inconsistent, unprofessional
4. WORST: Raw text without containers — different sizes, no alignment
```

### The Rule:
**When a proven approach already looks good, don't change it just because
a rule seems to say otherwise. The APPEARANCE is the judge, not the
specification.**

---

## LESSON 3: HEADER ICON BUTTONS NEED VISUAL CONTAINERS

### ❌ What went wrong:
Header back arrow was rendered as a raw vector chevron without a circle
background. The three dots were floating without a container. Both looked
broken and unfinished.

### ✅ The correct pattern:
Header icon buttons MUST have:
- A circular container (40-44px) with a subtle fill (surface2)
- The icon centered inside
- ALL header icon buttons the same size and style

```
WRONG:
  ← Credit Card  •••     (icons floating naked)

RIGHT:
  (←) Credit Card (•••)   (icons inside circles with bg)
```

### The Rule:
**Every interactive icon in a header or toolbar MUST be inside a tappable
container (circle or rounded rect) with a visible background. Naked floating
icons look broken.**

---

## LESSON 4: WHITESPACE IS NOT EMPTY — IT'S THE DESIGN

### ❌ What went wrong:
v2 had a larger credit card, larger balance text, and larger icon buttons.
This pushed everything down, eliminating breathing room. The screen felt
cramped despite having "correct" spacing values between sections.

### ✅ The correct interpretation:
Whitespace is measured by the OVERALL composition, not individual gaps.
If section-to-section spacing is 32px but each section is 20% larger,
the screen is DENSER, not more spacious.

```
WRONG: "I have 32px between sections, so spacing is correct"
RIGHT: "Does the overall screen FEEL light and airy? Can I breathe?"

The test: Can you see the BACKGROUND between sections?
If the content fills >80% of the visible viewport, it's too dense.
Aim for 60-70% content, 30-40% visible background.
```

### The Rule:
**After building a screen, zoom out to 50% and squint. The screen should
have visible "air" between major groups. If it's a solid wall of content,
reduce element sizes or increase section spacing until you can breathe.**

---

## LESSON 5: CENTER ALIGNMENT FOR HERO ELEMENTS

### ❌ What went wrong:
v2 left-aligned the balance value ($2,847.50) which made it feel like
just another text element. The balance is supposed to be THE HERO.

### ✅ The correct interpretation:
Hero elements (the one piece of information that dominates the screen)
should be CENTERED to create visual weight and importance.

```
WRONG: Left-aligned balance next to a right-aligned date
       $2,847.50                    Due Mar 15

RIGHT: Centered balance, with supporting text below
                Current Bill
                $1,247.30
                Due Mar 15
```

### The Rule:
**If an element is the HERO (the largest, most important value on the screen),
center it. Centering creates visual gravity and signals "this is THE thing."
Supporting/contextual info goes below it, also centered.**

---

## LESSON 6: MATCHING ELEMENTS MUST BE VISUALLY IDENTICAL

### ❌ What went wrong:
v2 used different colors for merchant transaction icons (red for Netflix,
green for Spotify, orange for Amazon). This created visual chaos and drew
attention to decoration instead of information.

### ✅ The correct pattern:
All elements in a LIST that serve the same FUNCTION must look identical
except for their content.

```
WRONG:
  🔴 N  Netflix      -$15.99    (red draws attention here)
  🟢 S  Spotify      -$11.99    (green draws attention here)
  🟠 A  Amazon       -$84.30    (the amounts are lost)

RIGHT:
  ⬛ N  Netflix      -$15.99    (neutral — eye goes to the name + amount)
  ⬛ U  Uber         -$24.50    (consistent — easy to scan the list)
  ⬛ A  Amazon       -$84.30    (the INFORMATION hierarchy is preserved)
```

### The Rule:
**In a list of items, visual decoration (icons, colors) should be
UNIFORM so the eye can focus on the CONTENT (names, amounts, dates).
The only exception is status indicators (pending, completed, failed).**

## THE DESIGN JUDGMENT CHECKLIST

Before finalizing ANY screen, answer these questions:

### 1. Color Check
- [ ] How many distinct non-neutral colors are visible? (Target: ≤2)
- [ ] Does the accent color appear in ≤5% of the screen?
- [ ] Are there any semantic colors (red/green) that aren't for actual status?

### 2. Breathing Room Check
- [ ] Zoom to 50% and squint — can you see background between sections?
- [ ] Is the content ≤70% of the visible viewport?
- [ ] Is the hero element given generous vertical space?

### 3. Consistency Check
- [ ] Are all header icon buttons the same size and style?
- [ ] Are all list items visually identical (except content)?
- [ ] Are all quick action buttons the same size, color, and corner radius?

### 4. Polish Check
- [ ] Do icon buttons have visible container backgrounds?
- [ ] Are icons rendered cleanly (not crude vector paths)?
- [ ] Is the hero element centered and dominant?

### 5. Restraint Check
- [ ] Did I resist adding a color "just because the brand has that color"?
- [ ] Did I resist making elements bigger "because the rule says X size"?
- [ ] If I compare to Nubank/Cash App — is my screen as SIMPLE as theirs?

## WHEN RULES CONFLICT WITH JUDGMENT

```
1. Build the screen following the rules
2. Take a screenshot
3. Ask: "Does this LOOK good? Does it feel premium?"
4. If NO — identify which rule application is causing the problem
5. Adjust the rule's interpretation, keeping the SPIRIT
6. Screenshot again and compare
7. The version that LOOKS better wins

The screenshot is the ultimate judge. Not the specification.
```

## REFERENCE: THE v1 vs v2 vs v3 COMPARISON

This lesson came from building 3 versions of a credit card screen:

| Element | v1 (good) | v2 (worse) | v3 (best) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header icons | Circle + bg | Naked, broken | Circle + bg ✅ |
| Merchant icons | All neutral | Brand colors | All neutral ✅ |
| Available text | Neutral gray | Green accent | Neutral gray ✅ |
| Balance | Centered | Left-aligned | Centered ✅ |
| Breathing room | Generous | Cramped | Generous ✅ |
| Action icons | Clean text | Crude vectors | Clean text ✅ |
| Color count | 1 (blue) | 4 (blue+red+green+orange) | 1 (blue-purple) ✅ |

**v2 was worse DESPITE having more rules** because the rules were applied
mechanically. v3 is better because the rules were applied with JUDGMENT.
