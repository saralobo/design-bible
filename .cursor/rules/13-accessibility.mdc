# Accessibility — Inclusive Design (WCAG 2.2)

> Accessibility is not a feature, it's a foundation.
> 15% of the world's population has some disability. 8% of men have color blindness.
> Accessible design is BETTER design for EVERYONE.

---

## WCAG 2.2 — PRACTICAL SUMMARY

### 4 Principles (POUR):
| Principle | Meaning | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **Perceivable** | Can see/hear/feel | Is the content visible and legible? |
| **Operable** | Can interact | Can I navigate and act? |
| **Understandable** | Can comprehend | Is the meaning clear? |
| **Robust** | Works everywhere | Does it work on different devices/assistive tech? |

### Conformance Levels:
| Level | Description | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Basic minimum | Yes, ALWAYS |
| **AA** | Industry standard | Yes, primary target |
| **AAA** | Maximum excellence | Ideal, when possible |

---

## CONTRAST (The most violated)

### Minimum Ratios:
| Context | AA (minimum) | AAA (ideal) |
|---|---|---|
| Normal text (< 18px) | **4.5:1** | 7:1 |
| Large text (≥ 18px bold / ≥ 24px) | **3:1** | 4.5:1 |
| UI components (borders, icons) | **3:1** | — |
| Focus indicators | **3:1** | — |
| Non-text (graphics, icons) | **3:1** | — |

### Quick Verification:
- Use tools: Stark (Figma plugin), WebAIM contrast checker
- In dark mode, contrast is often WORSE — double-check

### RULE:
> Before finalizing any screen, check contrast of ALL text.
> If it doesn't meet 4.5:1, change the color. No discussion.

## TOUCH TARGETS (WCAG 2.2 New!)

### 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) — Level AA:
- **Minimum**: 24×24px (WCAG 2.2 AA absolute minimum)
- **Recommended**: 44×44px (Apple HIG)
- **Ideal**: 48×48dp (Material Design)

### Spacing between targets:
- If touch target is < 44px, the space to the next target must compensate
- Minimum spacing between targets: 8px

### Exceptions (where target < 24px is acceptable):
- Inline links in the middle of paragraphs
- Targets that have an adequate-size equivalent in another position

---

## COLOR IS NOT THE ONLY INDICATOR

### WCAG 1.4.1 — Use of Color:
> Color can NEVER be the ONLY means of conveying information.

| ❌ Color Only | ✅ Color + Alternative |
|---|---|
| Red field = error | Red field + ⚠️ icon + text "Invalid ID" |
| Green = success | Green + ✓ icon + text "Sent successfully" |
| Blue link (no underline) | Blue link + underline |
| Chart with colors | Chart with colors + labels + patterns |
| Red badge | Red badge + number |

---

## FOCUS HIERARCHY (Focus Management)

### Tab Order:
- The focus order (Tab) must follow the visual order: top → bottom, left → right
- NEVER skip interactive elements
- NEVER change the tab order unexpectedly

### Focus Indicators:
- **Style**: 2px accent ring/outline with 2px offset
- **Visibility**: ALWAYS visible (never `outline: none` without alternative)
- **Contrast**: 3:1 against the adjacent background

### Focus Trap (Modals):
- When modal opens, focus goes to the first interactive element in the modal
- Tab navigates ONLY within the modal (doesn't escape behind)
- When modal closes, focus returns to the element that opened the modal

---

## TEXT AND LEGIBILITY

### Minimum Sizes:
| Context | Minimum Size |
|---|---|
| Body text | 16px |
| Caption/Helper | 12px (NEVER smaller) |
| Button label | 14px |
| Input text | 16px (prevents iOS zoom) |
| Badge/Counter | 10px (with contrasting background) |

### Line Height:
- Body text: 1.4-1.5 (easier reading for dyslexia)
- Paragraph: Maximum 66-75 characters per line (ideal legibility)

### Weight:
- NEVER use font-weight 100/200 (Thin/ExtraLight) — illegible
- NEVER use font-weight 300 (Light) at sizes < 18px

---

## LABELS AND DESCRIPTIONS

### Every interactive element MUST have:
1. **Visible label**: Text that describes the field/button
2. **Accessible name**: For screen readers (can be the visible label)
3. **Description** (when needed): Additional help text

### Inputs:
- ALWAYS visible label above the field
- Placeholder does NOT replace label
- Helper text for additional instructions
- Error messages associated with the field

### Standalone Icons:
- Icon without text MUST have an accessible label
- Ex: Button with 🔍 icon needs `aria-label="Search"`
- Exception: Decorative icons next to text (they're redundant)

---

## SEMANTICS AND STRUCTURE

### Heading Hierarchy:
```
h1: Screen title (1 per screen)
  h2: Main sections
    h3: Sub-sections
      h4: If needed (rare on mobile)
```
- NEVER skip levels (h1 → h3 without h2)
- Screen readers use headings to navigate

### Landmarks/Regions:
- Header: Main navigation
- Main: Primary content
- Footer: Bottom nav/info
- Navigation: Menu, tabs, breadcrumbs

---

## MOTION AND ACCESSIBILITY

### Prefers-reduced-motion:
- Respect the user's system preference
- If `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:
  - Disable long animations (> 300ms)
  - Replace slide/scale with fade or direct cut
  - Keep essential feedback (press state)
  - Disable parallax and auto-play

### Epilepsy (WCAG 2.3):
- NEVER: Flash more than 3 times per second
- NEVER: Red flash + large areas
- Be careful with: Pulsating animations, strobes, animated patterns

---

## COLOR BLINDNESS

### Most common types:
| Type | % Men | Confuses |
|---|---|---|
| Deuteranopia (green) | 6% | Green ↔ Red |
| Protanopia (red) | 2% | Red ↔ Green |
| Tritanopia (blue) | 0.01% | Blue ↔ Yellow |
| Achromatopsia (total) | 0.003% | Everything → gray |

### RULES:
- Red and green TOGETHER need an extra differentiator (icon, pattern, label)
- Charts: Use patterns (lines, dots) in addition to color
- Status: ✓ check + green, ✕ cross + red, ⚠ triangle + yellow
- Test with color blindness simulator (Figma plugin: "Color Blind")

---

## STATES FOR SCREEN READERS

### Automatic announcements (aria-live):
| Type | When to Announce |
|---|---|
| Validation error | Immediately (assertive) |
| Success toast | After 100ms (polite) |
| Content loading | "Loading..." |
| Content loaded | "Content updated" |
| Count updated | "3 notifications" |

---
